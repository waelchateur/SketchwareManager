# Receiving and managing project data (logic, view, resources, libraries)

In Sketchware, project data is divided into files `file`, `view`, `resource`, `logic`, `library`.

### logic

The `logic` file stores data about the project logic: events, moreblocks, variables.

### view

The `view` file stores data, oddly enough, about the view in projects (individual widgets (like fab or drawer)
or the entire activity at once).

### resource

The `resource` file stores data about the project resources: images, fonts, sounds.

### library

The `library` file stores data about active and inactive libraries in a project.

### file

The file `file` is responsible for listing all activities, custom views.
